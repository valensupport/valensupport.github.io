# Valen Customer Specific Swagger definition

### Integrating webservices for Predict on InsureRight® Platform 3.0

The InsureRight® Predict Web Service (PWS) allows clients to send input data, in the form of a prediction request, to the InsureRight platform for scoring with Valen’s models. Once received, the system validates the XML/JSON and data content of the transmission, scores the data, then returns a prediction response.

In addition to the score results, the system also returns information to explain the predictions in terms of influential data elements. Optionally, Valen can incorporate custom business rules to provide support for automated decision making based on the prediction results.

##### Audience

This guide is intended for use by developers who are building web-enabled applications that will use the PWS to invoke an application to score a set of input data. To use the PWS, clients are required to have a valid  account with Valen. Please contact <support@valen.com> to ensure that access is properly configured.

#### How to get access to your specific Swagger definition

The swagger defintion for inputs and outputs will vary by customer.  In order to find out the exact inputs required, and the expected outputs in a response, a valid login to the valen system is required.  Go to the Valen website at https://insureight.valen.com and login with your credentials.  Under the Tools option, select the API Documentation option.
This is the complete set of API's available for integration purposes.
